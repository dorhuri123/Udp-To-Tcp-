# Udp-To-Tcp-
**A little preview -** As you might know, udp is a straight foword protocal who just "sends and hopes for the best". On the other hand, Tcp is a more sofisticated protocol that make sure all data has been received properly(in the currect order, etc...).<br>

**Description -** In this project, we have a client-sever protocol that uses an udp socket that implements tcp protocol in the aplication layer, resulting a "Udp-To-Tcp" socket.
